    * Use "Import" to load images, "Crop" to crop selections, and "Transform" for rotations/flips.
    * In the "View" section, toggle gridlines and rulers, and adjust zoom.
    * Under "Settings", switch themes or change canvas properties.
    * The bottom status bar provides real-time information.

    * For text, select the "Text" tool, click on the canvas, and enter your text in the dialog.
    * Use `Ctrl+Z` for Undo and `Ctrl+Y` for Redo (or the buttons in the "Edit" section).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

* **Themes:** Switch between "Light Theme" and "Dark Theme" from the "Settings" section.
* **Canvas Background:** Change the canvas background color via the "Canvas Color" button in "Settings".
* **Default Brush Size:** The application remembers your last used brush size.
