## 🎨 Usage

1.  **Run the application:**

2.  **Explore the Interface:**
    * The top section contains toolbars for **File**, **Edit**, **Tools**, **Brush Options**, **Shapes**, **Colors**, **Image**, **View**, and **Settings**.
    * Click on tool buttons to select drawing modes (Brush, Eraser, Pencil, Fill, Text, Color Picker, Zoom, Selection).
    * Choose shapes (Line, Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Star) from the "Shapes" section.
    * Adjust brush size using the slider and brush type using the dropdown.
    * Select colors from the palette or use the "Pick Color" button.
    * Use "Import" to load images, "Crop" to crop selections, and "Transform" for rotations/flips.
    * In the "View" section, toggle gridlines and rulers, and adjust zoom.
    * Under "Settings", switch themes or change canvas properties.
    * The bottom status bar provides real-time information.

3.  **Drawing:**
    * Select a tool/shape and click/drag on the canvas.
    * For text, select the "Text" tool, click on the canvas, and enter your text in the dialog.
    * Use `Ctrl+Z` for Undo and `Ctrl+Y` for Redo (or the buttons in the "Edit" section).

## ⚙️ Customization

* **Themes:** Switch between "Light Theme" and "Dark Theme" from the "Settings" section.
* **Canvas Background:** Change the canvas background color via the "Canvas Color" button in "Settings".
* **Default Brush Size:** The application remembers your last used brush size.
* **Gridlines & Rulers:** Toggle their visibility from the "View" section.
* **`paint_settings.json`:** The application saves user preferences (theme, default brush size, canvas background, grid/ruler visibility) in a `paint_settings.json` file in the application directory. You can manually edit this file, but it's generally recommended to use the in-app settings.
